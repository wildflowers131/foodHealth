# This is the first application that I was asked to built that wraps everything that I've learned so far
in the Bloc's Web Development track bootcamp. 

This application was built using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery. 

This was a challenging task since there were many moments where I got stuck in my coding. Sometimes, one step forward will result in two steps backward.
Applications that seem user friendly definitely requires planning and problem solving when developing, which user will never get to see.
This makes me appreciate web applications in a new way. I won't look at websites the same way anymore.
